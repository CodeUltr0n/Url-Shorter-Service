üôå Closing Note

This project was developed as part of an internship assignment to demonstrate practical skills in full-stack development, API integration, and UI/UX design. It reflects:
	‚Ä¢	A solid understanding of modern web development with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
	‚Ä¢	Integration of database and RESTful APIs
	‚Ä¢	A focus on performance, design, and user experience

I‚Äôm excited about the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to real-world projects and continue growing as a developer.
